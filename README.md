# reports-templates
## Rmarkdown templates for formal and informal reports. 

## Formal reports

formal-report-template.tex and formal-report.Rmd are the latex and R markdown templates for a formal report 
containing a title page with space for an optional logo. 
This began as a heavily modified version of Sebastian Sauer's yart template at 
[https://github.com/sebastiansauer/yart](https://github.com/sebastiansauer/yart). 
Also includes elements of Steven Miller's article template at 
[https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates). 
It is free for anyone's use under the terms of GPL-3; see LICENSE.md. 

## Informal reports

informal-report-template.tex and informal-report.Rmd are the latex and R markdown templates for for an informal 
report with no title page, resembling in format article manuscripts submitted to journals in political science or economics. 
It is intended for use with the corresponding latex template informal-report-template.tex. It is heavily indebted to Steven 
Miller's article template at [https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates), 
but has accumulated various changes (sometimes enhancements) as I've used it. 
It is free for anyone's use under the terms of the MIT license; see LICENSE.md.
